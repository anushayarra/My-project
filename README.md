# steps to run the test cases 
--Take code from git first
--Need to install yarn first after taking pull from master
--run init yarn
--refer the package.json for the commands
--We can run the cypress in two ways one is headless and one is headed
--And beautiful thing to run cypress is that we can create our own commands in package.json
--Have written two commands as of now
--Run this command to run the cypress after setting up in local  yarn test-open:basicSuite
--added screenshots as proofs of passing testing cases in evidences file


**NOTE : If test cases are failing try to reload the cases in cypress UI
